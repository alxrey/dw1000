/*****************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. The device ID is a hard coded constant in the blink to keep the example 
 *    simple but for a real product every device should have a unique ID.
 *    For development purposes it is possible to generate a DW1000 unique ID 
 *    by combining the Lot ID & Part Number values programmed into the
 *    DW1000 during its manufacture. However there is no guarantee this will 
 *    not conflict with someone else's implementation. We recommended that
 *    customers buy a block of addresses from the IEEE Registration Authority 
 *    for their production items. See "EUI" in the DW1000 User Manual.
 * 2. In this example, LDE microcode is not loaded upon calling dwt_initialise().
 *    This will prevent the IC from generating an RX timestamp. 
 *    If time-stamping is required, DWT_LOADUCODE parameter should be used. 
 *    See two-way ranging examples (e.g. examples 5a/5b).
 * 3. In a real application, for optimum performance within regulatory limits, 
 *    it may be necessary to set TX pulse bandwidth and TX power, (using
 *    the dwt_configuretxrf API call) to per device calibrated values saved in 
 *    the target system or the DW1000 OTP memory.
 * 4. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of tx_msg as a parameter but only 
 *    copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
 *    automatically appended by the DW1000. This means that our tx_msg could 
 *    be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
 *    work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of
 *    the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
 * 5. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as 
 *    possible but the TXFRS status event can be used to generate an interrupt.
 *    Please refer to DW1000 User Manual for more details on "interrupts".
 * 6. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with 
 *    EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *    DW1000 API Guide for more details on the DW1000 driver functions.
